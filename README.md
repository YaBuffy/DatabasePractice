# DatabasePractice

A small Android application to practice working with Room, ViewModel, and Jetpack Compose.

The app allows you to:
- add notes to a local database (Room);
- display a list of saved notes;
- delete notes;
- use the MVVM pattern with ViewModel;
- build modern UI with Jetpack Compose.
